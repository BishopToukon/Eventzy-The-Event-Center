          <h2>The Double Act</h2>
          <p>
            This dynamic duo brings all the heat with hand-breaded chicken
            tenders—juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside—teamed up with a
            generous helping of golden, seasoned fries. It&#39;s a power pairing
            that hits every craveable note, from the first crunch to the last
            dip. Choose your favorite sauces and let the flavor setlist play—The
            Double Act isn&#39;t just a meal, it&#39;s the main event your
            tastebuds didn&#39;t know they were waiting for.

          <h2>The Headliner</h2>
          <p>
            This show-stopper brings the best of both worlds: a juicy all-beef
            hot dog wrapped in seasoned ground beef, flame-grilled to
            perfection, and smothered in melted cheddar. Topped with crispy
            onions, pickles, and our signature backstage sauce, all tucked into
            a toasted brioche bun. It&#39;s loud, loaded, and built to bring the
            house down.

            The Party Starter kicks things off with a juicy, flame-grilled beef
            patty stacked with sharp cheddar, crispy bacon, and a tangy house
            sauce that brings the heat. Topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles,
            and nestled in a toasted brioche bun — it&#39;s bold, messy, and
            impossible to eat quietly. One bite, and the party&#39;s officially
            on.

          <h2>Detroit Stomper</h2>
          <p>
            Our Detroit Stomper is a brick-oven masterpiece: deep-dish,
            caramelized cheese edges, layered with zesty house-made marinara on
            top of buttery, airy crust. Loaded with spicy pepperoni, Italian
            sausage, and a blend of melted mozzarella and brick cheese that
            sinks into every corner.

            a front-row set. But we don&#39;t stop at the classics—The Crowd
            Pleaser can be dressed to thrill with butter, cheese dust, spicy
